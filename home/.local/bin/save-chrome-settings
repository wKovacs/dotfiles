# Chrome has a bug which cause a restore pop-up every time chrome was closed by
# OS an not by hand
# to avoid this bug 2 config files are set to read-only which also will block
# saving of settings changes

# to save changes first run this script, which will set the files to writeable
# and then will wait until changes in chromes were made. 
# restart chrome
# Confirm restart and script will set read-only again
